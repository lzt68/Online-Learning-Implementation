## File and Folder

"Figure": this folder contains the screenshot of the paper, as illustration in Neural Thompson.ipynb

GameSetting.py: this script contains the function to generate context and reward in each round

UCB_Exploration.ipynb: this notebook implement the algorithm, with using numpy to implement the neural network, without using pytorch or tensorflow or something like that
Gradient_of_loss_function_and_neural_network.md: This file contains the mathematical derivation of backward propogation
NeuralNetworkRelatedFunction.py: this script contains the necessary function to run a neural network, implemented by numpy
