This folder contains the implementation of algorithm in *Neural Contextual Bandits with UCB-based Exploration* 

## File and Folder

"Figure": This folder contains the screenshot of the paper, as illustration in Neural Thompson.ipynb

"Source": This folder contains the source file of different algorithms and game setting.

+ agent.py: The source file of neural ucb, uniform sampling and best arm
+ GameSetting.py: this script contains the function to generate context and reward in each round

UCB_Exploration.ipynb: this notebook implement the algorithm, with using numpy to implement the neural network, without using pytorch or tensorflow or something like that
