# Online-Learning-Implementation
This project aims to implement those algorithms from different papers related to online learning (Updating).
I am a fresh player on this topic. I would use this project the trace my study on online learning. And I sincerely wish this project can also help you better understand those online learning algorithms. Communication is also welcome.

**This project only includes the reproduction of the most simple numeric experiments mentioned in these papers**

## Prerequisite

**Ide**

+ jupyter notebook

## File and Folder

Following folders contain the code and the description of corresponding papers, with further details and description

A method for generating uniformly distributed points on N-dimensional spheres.pdf: This paper show us how to generate uniformly distributed points on a N-dimension ball. Its conclusion can be used to generate context in each round.
