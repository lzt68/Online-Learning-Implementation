# Ferrira-et-al-2018-Thompson_Sampling
This folder contains the implementation of 5 algorithms in *Online Network Revenue Management Using Thompson Sampling* (Updating)

## Prerequisite

In this paper, we need to repeatedly solve a linear optimization problem, here we used SCIP as out solve. (You may replace it with gurobi or others). 

Following links may help you install SCIP and its python interface

+ https://www.scipopt.org/index.php#welcome Welcome page of SCIP
+ https://www.scipopt.org/index.php#download Download page
+ **REMINDER 1: you might need to edit the system variable**
+ **REMINDER 2: To install SCIP, Visual C++ Redistributable Packages are required. You can also download these packages in the download page**
+ https://github.com/scipopt/PySCIPOpt After you successfully install SCIP, you can install the python interface. This is the github link of pyscipopt
