# README

This folder contains the implementation of **One Time Learning** and **Dynamic Learning** algorithms mentioned in Agrawal et al. 2014 *A Dynamic Near-Optimal Algorithm for Online Linear Programming*.

The paper doesn't include numeric experiments, thus I used simple synthesis setting to compare the performance of these two algorithms.

## File Structure

Experiments.ipynb: Demo of using the source file of these two algorithms

"Source":

+ agent.py: The source file of **One Time Learning** and **Dynamic Learning** algorithms.
+ env.py: The source file of environment that interact with the agent
